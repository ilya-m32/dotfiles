# Ilya's dotfiles

My personal stash of configuration files for applications I use on a daily basis.

The repository consist of:
- neovim config (though vim compatable)
- zsh + oh-my-zsh with a custom theme
- tmux with a custom theme
- A little bootstraping script (mostly for the Ubuntu-based systems)
